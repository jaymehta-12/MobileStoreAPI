Mobile Store Web Api.

1.File- MobileItems.cs(Model)

-In this model class I have mentioned the required properties for my Api.

-Here in this model file parameter ID is set as primary key with the help of using DataAnnotations.

2.File -MobileContext.cs
-In this model class I have build an constructor for passing Dbprovider which can be SQLServer etc .

- A property is also added with type DbSet for class MobileDetails.

3.File-Startup.cs

-In the file I have added service in ConfigurationService for dependency injection in my api by EF Core.

-Main key word here is UseSqlServer and here connection string is accesed inside this by calling function GETConnectionString.

4.File- Appsetting.json

-Here in this I have added connection string and created a connection named as MobileStore with instance of SQL as sqlexpress.


5-File- MobileItemController

-First in this I have created a private property _context of type MobileContext(Model class).

-Next is creating a constuctor which sets the property _context which is passed as a parameter.

-Whenever we create a controller with constructor parameter of type MobileContext, property which is Iservice(In starup.cs file) will provide the new instance of MobileContext into the the constuctor parameter _context.

-This is one the benift of ASP .NEt core as here dependency injection is implements by defualt.

-Next is all the method for CRUD operations where return type is IActionResult used.
